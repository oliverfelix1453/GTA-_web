                                Franklin Clinton is a young and ambitious character introduced in Grand Theft Auto V.
                                Born
                                and raised in the streets of South Los Santos, Franklin is determined to escape the
                                cycle of
                                poverty and crime that surrounds him. He works as a repo man for a shady car dealership,
                                repossessing cars from delinquent clients.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                What sets Franklin apart is his desire for a better life and his reluctance to be
                                entangled
                                in the gang culture that dominates his neighborhood. He represents the pursuit of the
                                American Dream in a city filled with crime and corruption. Franklin is more level-headed
                                and
                                strategic compared to his counterparts, Michael and Trevor, often serving as the voice
                                of
                                reason within the trio.

                                Trevor Philips is an explosively chaotic and unpredictable character in Grand Theft Auto
                                V.
                                Born and raised in Canada, Trevor is a former military pilot with a penchant for
                                violence
                                and an insatiable appetite for mayhem. He later becomes involved in criminal
                                enterprises,
                                particularly drug trafficking and methamphetamine production.

                                Trevor stands out among the protagonists with his wild and erratic behavior. He is
                                unhinged,
                                often reveling in chaos, violence, and destruction. His brutal and sadistic nature makes
                                him
                                a force to be feared, both by his enemies and, at times, by his allies. Despite his
                                erratic
                                tendencies, Trevor is a highly skilled and resourceful individual, making him a valuable
                                asset in heists and criminal operations.
